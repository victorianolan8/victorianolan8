- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @victorianolan8
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Warnell School of Forestry, University of Georgia, USA
- ðŸŒ± My current research is on the convservation and population modelling of Northern Bobwhite across the southern USA. We use a variety of data (point counts, acoustic ARU data, SECR etc.) to monitor bobwhite and predict population changes. I also have a wide interest in general species distribution modelling and large scale macroecological research questions at the landscape scale.
